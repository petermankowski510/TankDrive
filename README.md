# PiTanq
PiTanq is a home tank built with open source hardware and powered by Raspberry Pi. 

Its primary purpose is to help learning AI for vehicles like self-driving, mapping, location.

Also it is a nice toy.

## Hardware
PiTanq is based on an aluminum chassis (the motors are included).

The motors are controlled by L298N bridge.

Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian Jessie is a brain.

The tank equiped with 5MP PiCamera.

The camera mounted on pan-and-tilt stand managed by Raspberry via PWM controller.

The power comes from 2x1850 batteries.

Also there is an ultrasonic distance meter.

## Software
Raspbian Jessie runs on the Raspberry. 

Python service (from this repo) controls the whole tank via REST interface.

This service uses AI frameworks:
- Tensoflow (built by [Sam Abrahams](https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi))
- OpenCV (built by [me](https://github.com/tprlab/pi-opencv))

And third-party driver for PWM controller from [SunFounder](https://github.com/tprlab/pitanq/blob/master/PCA9685_license.txt)

## Phone application
There is an [android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tprlab.com.pitanq) to control the tank.
Whenever I will learn IOS then an Apple app will be available. Not now.
